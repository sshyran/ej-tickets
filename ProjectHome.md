I was not able to find an open source ticket system that was flexible enough for my requirements.  In particular, I needed certain features;

  * Simplistic and super-fast creation of multiple tickets.  As a service to my clients, I want a ticket system that allows them to punch in multiple tickets at a time.
  * Configurable work flow.  Tickets may need multiple stages, including programmer spec, project manager approval, client approval, in progress, code complete, QA complete, closed by QA or closed by client.
  * Flexible comment system
  * Attachable documents
  * Time acccounting, sometimes visible to the client and/or project manager.
  * Coded to a sufficiently high standard such that I can actually extend the code with a minimum of time and effort.
  * Flexible multi-site configuration.

There appears to be a significant dearth of quality PHP ticketinng systems that can be installed on commodity-grade hosting services.  This system is designed to help fill that niche.
